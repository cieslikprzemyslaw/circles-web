# circles-web

## How to start?

### 1. Clone
First of all we need to clone the project.

`git clone https://github.com/DRFR0ST/circles-web.git`

### 2. Setup env variables
In order to run the project and make it communicate with our development server, you have to add an `.env` file in the root.
The content of it can be obtained on our [Discord channel called `resources`](https://discord.gg/JyPFtzPa) but it's available only for the `contributor` role.

### 3. Install deps
Now just install projects dependencies like you always do. Since we use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), please install it, if you didn't yet.

`yarn install` or just `yarn`

### 4. Start server
Last thing is to start the development server.

Type in `yarn start`, hit enter, wait a few seconds/minutes and you are ready to write code!
Have fun!
